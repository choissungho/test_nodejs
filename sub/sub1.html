<p> A dream written down with a data becomes a GOAL
A goal broken down become a PLAN
A plan baked by ACTION makes your dream come true
you are the one i have waited for in my life.
If you can imagine it,
you can create it.
If you can dream it,
you can become it.
So Thank you for being
the person who taught me to Love</p>
